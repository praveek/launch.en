# Adobe Experience Platform Launch object reference

This document serves as a reference for the client-side `_satellite` object (also called the Adobe Experience Platform Launch object) and the various functions you can perform with it.

## `track`

**Code**

```javascript
_satellite.track(identifier: string [, detail: *] )
```

**Example**

```javascript
_satellite.track('contact_submit', { name: 'John Doe' });
```

Fires all rules using the Direct Call event type from the Core extension that has been configured with the given identifier. The above example triggers all rules using a Direct Call event type where the configured identifier is `contact_submit`. An optional object containing related information is also passed. The detail object can be accessed by entering `%event.detail%` within a text field in a condition or action or `event.detail` inside the code editor in a Custom Code condition or action.

## `getVar`

**Code**

```javascript
_satellite.getVar(name: string) => *
```

**Example**

```javascript
var product = _satellite.getVar('product');
```

If a data element exists with a matching name, the data element's value will be returned. If no matching data element exists, it will then check to see if a custom variable with a matching name has previously been set using `_satellite.setVar()`. If a matching custom variable is found, its value will be returned.

Note that in many form fields in the [!DNL Platform Launch] user interface, you can use the `%%` syntax to reference variables, reducing the need to call `_satellite.getVar()`. For example, using %product% will access the value of the product data element or custom variable.

## `setVar`

**Code**

```javascript
_satellite.setVar(name: string, value: *)
```

**Example**

```javascript
_satellite.setVar('product', 'Circuit Pro');
```

Sets a custom variable with a given name and value. The value of the variable can later be accessed using `_satellite.getVar()`.

You may optionally set multiple variables at once by passing an object where the keys are variable names and the values are the respective variable values.

```javascript
_satellite.setVar({ 'product': 'Circuit Pro', 'category': 'hobby' });
```

## `getVisitorId`

**Code**

```javascript
_satellite.getVisitorId() => Object
```

**Example**

```javascript
var visitorIdInstance = _satellite.getVisitorId();
```

If the [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud ID] extension is installed on the property, this method returns the Visitor ID instance. See the [Experience Cloud ID Service documentation](https://forums.adobe.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmarketing.adobe.com%2Fresources%2Fhelp%2Fen_US%2Fmcvid%2F) for more information.

## `logger`

**Code**

```javascript
_satellite.logger.log(message: string)
```

```javascript
_satellite.logger.info(message: string)
```

```javascript
_satellite.logger.warn(message: string)
```

```javascript
_satellite.logger.error(message: string)
```

**Example**

```javascript
_satellite.logger.error('No product ID found.');
```

Logs a message to the browser console. The message will only be displayed if [!DNL Platform Launch] debugging is enabled by the user (by calling `_satellite.setDebug(true)` or using an appropriate browser extension).

### Logging Deprecation Warnings

```javascript
_satellite.logger.deprecation(message: string)
```

**Example**

```javascript
_satellite.logger.deprecation('This method is no longer supported, plese use [new example] instead.');
```

Logs a warning to the browser console. The message is displayed whether or not [!DNL Platform Launch] debugging is enabled by the user.

## `cookie`

**Code**

```javascript
_satellite.cookie.set(name: string, value: string[, attributes: Object])
```

```javascript
_satellite.cookie.get(name: string) => string
```

```javascript
_satellite.cookie.remove(name: string)
```

**Example**

```javascript
// Writing a cookie that expires in one week.
_satellite.cookie.set('product', 'Circuit Pro', { expires: 7 });
```

```javascript
// Reading a previously set cookie.
var product = _satellite.cookie.get('product');
```

```javascript
// Removing a previously set cookie.
_satellite.cookie.remove('product');
```

A utility for reading and writing cookies. This is an exposed copy of the third-party library js-cookie. For more advanced usage, please review the [js-cookie usage documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-cookie#basic-usage) (external link).

## `buildInfo`

**Code**

```javascript
_satellite.buildInfo
```

This object contains information about the build of the current [!DNL Platform Launch] runtime library. The object contains the following properties:

### `turbineVersion`

The [Turbine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@adobe/reactor-turbine) version used inside the current library.

### `turbineBuildDate`

The ISO 8601 date when the version of [Turbine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@adobe/reactor-turbine) used inside the container was built.

### `buildDate`

The ISO 8601 date when the current library was built.

### `environment`

The environment for which this library was built. The possible values are:

* development
* staging
* production

This example demonstrates the object values:

```javascript
{
  turbineVersion: "14.0.0",
  turbineBuildDate: "2016-07-01T18:10:34Z",
  buildDate: "2016-03-30T16:27:10Z",
  environment: "development"
}
```

## `notify`

>[!NOTE]
>
>This method has been deprecated. Please use `_satellite.logger.log()` instead.

**Code**

```javascript
_satellite.notify(message: string[, level: number])
```

**Example**

```javascript
_satellite.notify('Hello world!');
```

Logs a message to the browser console. The message will only be displayed if [!DNL Platform Launch] debugging is enabled by the user (by calling `_satellite.setDebug(true)` or using an appropriate browser extension).

An optional logging level can be passed which will affect styling and filtering of the message being logged. Supported levels are as follows:

3 - Informational messages.

4 - Warning messages.

5 - Error messages.

If you do not provide a logging level or pass any other level value, the message will be logged as a regular message.

## `setCookie`

>[!NOTE]
>
>This method has been deprecated. Please use `_satellite.cookie.set()` instead.

**Code**

```javascript
_satellite.setCookie(name: string, value: string, days: number)
```

**Example**

```javascript
_satellite.setCookie('product', 'Circuit Pro', 3);
```

Sets a cookie in the user's browser. The cookie will persist for the number of days specified.

## `readCookie`

>[!NOTE]
>
>This method has been deprecated. Please use `_satellite.cookie.get()` instead.

**Code**

```javascript
_satellite.readCookie(name: string) => string
```

**Example**

```javascript
var product = _satellite.readCookie('product');
```

Reads a cookie from the user's browser.

## `removeCookie`

>[!NOTE]
>
>This method has been deprecated. Please use `_satellite.cookie.remove()` instead.

**Code**

```javascript
_satellite.removeCookie(name: string)
```

**Example**

```javascript
_satellite.removeCookie('product');
```

Removes a cookie from the user's browser.

## Debugging Functions

The following functions should not be accessed from production code. They are intended only for debugging purposes and will change over time as needed.

### `container`

**Code**

```javascript
_satellite._container
```

**Example**

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This function should not be accessed from production code. It is intended only for debugging purposes and will change over time as needed.

### `monitor`

**Code**

```javascript
_satellite._monitors
```

**Example**

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This function should not be accessed from production code. It is intended only for debugging purposes and will change over time as needed.

**Sample**

On your web page running a [!DNL Platform Launch] library, add a snippet of code to your HTML. Typically, the code is placed in the `<head>` tag before the `<script>` tag that loads the [!DNL Platform Launch] library. This allows the monitor to catch the earliest system events that occur in the [!DNL Platform Launch] library. For example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Title</title>
  <script>
    window._satellite = window._satellite || {};
    window._satellite._monitors = window._satellite._monitors || [];
    window._satellite._monitors.push({
      ruleTriggered: function (event) {
        console.log(
          'rule triggered',
          event.rule
        );
      },
      ruleCompleted: function (event) {
        console.log(
          'rule completed',
          event.rule
        );
      },
      ruleConditionFailed: function (event) {
        console.log(
          'rule condition failed',
          event.rule,
          event.condition
        );
      }
    });
  </script>
  <script src="//assets.adobedtm.com/launch-EN5bfa516febde4b22b3e7c6f96f6b439f.min.js"
          async></script>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Click me!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

In the first script tag, because the [!DNL Platform Launch] library has not been loaded yet, the initial `_satellite` object is created and an array on `_satellite._monitors` is initialized. The script then adds a monitor object to that array. The monitor object can specify the following methods which will later be called by the [!DNL Platform Launch] library:

### `ruleTriggered`

Called after an event triggers a rule but before the rule's conditions and actions have been processed. The event object passed to `ruleTriggered` contains information about the rule that was triggered.

### `ruleCompleted`

Called after a rule has been fully processed. In other words, the event has occurred, all conditions have passed, and all actions have executed. The event object passed to `ruleCompleted` contains information about the rule that completed.

### `ruleConditionFailed`

Called after a rule has been triggered and one of its conditions has failed. The event object passed to `ruleConditionFailed` contains information about the rule that was triggered and the condition that failed.

If `ruleTriggered` is called, either `ruleCompleted` or `ruleConditionFailed` will be called shortly thereafter.

>[!NOTE]
>
>A monitor doesn't have to specify all three methods (`ruleTriggered`, `ruleCompleted`, and `ruleConditionFailed`). Platform Launch works with whatever supported methods have been provided by the monitor.

### Testing the Monitor

The example above specifies all three methods in the monitor. When they're called, the monitor logs out relevant information. To test this, set up two rules in the [!DNL Platform Launch] library:

1. A rule that has a click event and a browser condition that passes only if the browser is [!DNL Chrome].
1. A rule that has a click event and a browser condition that passes only if the browser is [!DNL Firefox].

If you open the page in [!DNL Chrome], open the browser console, and select the page, the following appears in the console:

![](/help/assets/debug.png)

Additional hooks or additional information might be added to theses handlers as needed.
