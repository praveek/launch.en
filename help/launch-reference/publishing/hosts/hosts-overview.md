# Hosts overview

Extensions, rules, and data elements are building blocks. When you want to make your application do something, these building blocks are added to libraries and then a library is "built" into a build. Those builds are delivered to a hosted location.

Hosts define available destinations where the builds can be delivered. They come in two types:

* [Managed by Adobe](/help/launch-reference/publishing/hosts/managed-by-adobe-host.md) 
* [SFTP](/help/launch-reference/publishing/hosts/sftp-host.md)

For detailed information about each host type, please use the links above.

The same host can be used for multiple environments within a property.

For more information to help you decide between self-hosting and having Adobe manage the hosting for you, please read the [Self-hosting Guide](/help/launch-reference/publishing/hosts/self-hosting-libraries.md).
